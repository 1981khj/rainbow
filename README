Introduction
------------
Rainbow is an early prototype that provides video and audio capture
capabilities to web pages. It is currently distributed as a highly experimental
Firefox addon.

Rainbow uses libvidcap[1] to capture video, portaudio[2] to capture audio and
libraries from xiph[3] to encode them. These libraries are cross-platform,
but for the initial release we only support Minefield on 32-bit Macs.

Building
--------
If you wish to build the binary components yourself, fetch a recent build of
the Gecko2 SDK from:
    http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/nightly/latest-trunk/
After extracting, set the MOZSDKDIR environment variable to point to it and
simply run `make'.

Precompiled versions are of the dependencies are already included for
convenience, however if you wish to include custom versions of libvidcap,
libportaudio, libogg, libvorbis or libtheora; place them in the appropriate
directory in lib/ and the build system will automatically link with them.

You may set debug=1 to create a version of the XPCOM component with debugging
symbols.

-------------
Common Errors
-------------
"Error: Permission denied for <http://localhost> to call method
    UnnamedClass.toString on <>.
 Error: uncaught exception: unknown (can't convert to string)"

This usually means that a device to record audio or video was not found. If you
look at the command line (stderr) you will find a clearer error message. We need
to propogate this type of error correctly to JS.

"Error: window.navigator.service is undefined"

This can mean one of two things:

- You tried to access the API from a webpage hosted on a restricted domain.
  By default, Rainbow will only allow access to web pages served from localhost,
  but you may change that by adding more domains to the
    'extensions.rainbow.allowedDomains'
  preference through about:config. The value is simply a JSON array of domains.

- The binary component itself failed to load. This may because you are using
  an older version of Firefox, or that you are running the nightly on an
  unsupported platform (see below). If this is the case the error will be
  preceded by something like:

"Error: Components.classes['@labs.mozilla.com/media/recorder;1'] is undefined"

-----------
64-bit Macs
-----------
libvidcap uses a deprecated Quicktime API to capture video, which is unsupported
on 64-bit versions of Snow Leopard. Unfortunately our nightlies are universal
binaries, and in most cases will run in 64-bit mode, resulting in our binary
component remaining unloaded.

The correct way to fix this would be to update libvidcap to use the newer
Quicktime API, but that is not trivial because the new APIs are Objective-C
only. In the meantime, one can force Minefield to run in 32-bit mode as follows:

$ arch -i386 /Applications/Minefield.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin

-----------------------
Linux & Windows Support
-----------------------
All the libraries Rainbow depends on are "cross-platform", but building static
versions of them are kind of a pain. There are preliminary versions of them
in lib/ but:

- On Windows, video recording crashes as soon as painting on the canvas starts.
- On Linux, no devices are detected. This is presumably because portaudio was
  built without ALSA and JACK support, and libvidcap uses V4L as the backend.

In addition, on Windows libvidcap uses a deprecated version of the DirectX API.
This may be reason enough to rewrite libvidcap backends for both Windows & Mac.
